# PART C (coding)
## Part 2


### Data simulation

*Binomial distribution: it describes the probability of observing a given number of successes in N independent Bernoulli trials with probability p*
```{r}
rbinom(2,5000,.05)
```
Let's assume weâ€™re in charge of quality for a factory. We make 5000 components each Monday and Tuesday. Defective widgets must be reworked. We know that there is a 5% error rate. Each Monday and Tuesday we'll have to fix 254 and 249 components.


*Poisson distribution: it describes the probability that a given number of events occurs in a fixed time interval. The events are assumed to occur at a known average rate and independent from each other*
```{r}
rpois(5000,2)
```
